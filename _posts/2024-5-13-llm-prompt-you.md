I've always had the tendency to outsource my agencyâ€”rely on my friends, family, and the internet instead of making decisions for myself.
Once ChatGPT came out, I felt the need to bring it everything: personal problems, work decisions, even "what should I say in this birthday card."
I was usually looking for an answer, or at the least validation.

I feel very fortunate that I have a fully-developed brain while the AI revolution is happening, because I can recognize this problem and fix it for myself!
Large Language Models are incredibly capable, but prompt engineering matters because it "activates" the relevant information in the inner workings of the model.
Humans are pretty similar! We have a ton of knowledge, wisdom, and decision-making ability, and sometimes it takes the right prompt to bring those out.

I find that LLMs are very good at prompting me. 
When I'm facing big decisions, I often ask it to ask me questions instead of giving me answers. I find that to be incredibly helpful. 
For example, it might ask "If you looked back on this decision five years from now, what would you feel?" and that simple question will
evoke a lot of insight and clarity on my end. I had tunnel vision, and this prompted me to activate a different set of neurons. 
And hopefully, after that experience, my brain has been connected in useful ways, and I'll be better poised to take a long-term view on my personal problems in the future.

Of course, sometimes you just want an answer, but think about when you're missing out on the opportunity to shape and improve your own brain. Ask your LLM to prompt you!
