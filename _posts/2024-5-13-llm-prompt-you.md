I've always had the tendency to outsource my agencyâ€”rely on what my friends, family, and the internet say.
Once ChatGPT came out, I felt the need to bring it everything, from personal problems and work decisions to "what should I say in this birthday card?".
I was usually looking for an answer, or at the least validation.

I feel very fortunate that I have a fully-developed brain while the AI revolution is happening, because I can recognize this problem and fix it for myself. 
Large Language Models are incredibly capable, but prompt engineering matters because it "activates" the relevant information in the inner workings of the model.
Humans are pretty similar! We have a ton of knowledge, wisdom, and decision-making ability, and sometimes it takes the right prompt to bring those out.

I find that LLMs are very good at prompting me. When I talk to it about problems, I explicitly ask it to ask me quesitons instead of bringing out answers.
And I find that to be incredibly helpful. For example, it might ask "If you looked back on this decision five years from now, what would feel?" and that simple question 
evoked a lot of insight and clarity on my end. I had tunnel vision, and this prompted me to activate a different set of neurons. 
And hopefully, after that experience, my brain has been connected in useful ways, and I'll be better poised to take a long-term view on my personal problems.

Of course, sometimes you just want an answer. But think about when you're missing out on the opportunity to shape and improve your own brain. Ask your LLM to prompt you!
